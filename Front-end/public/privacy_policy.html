    <h3>2.3 Financial Information</h3>
    <p>If you act as a Seller or Overseer, we collect banking details (Account Number, Bank Name, Branch Code) to facilitate payouts and track subscription payments. We do not store full credit card numbers; these are processed by secure third-party payment gateways.</p>

    <h3>2.4 TACTSO Academic Data</h3>
    <p>For students using TACTSO services, we collect academic records, matric results, and identification documents required for university applications.</p>

    <h3>2.5 Proxy Data (Third-Party Information)</h3>
    <p>Where you register an account on behalf of another person (e.g., an elderly member), we process that person’s data based on your warranty that you have obtained their informed consent.</p>

    <h2>3. HOW WE USE YOUR INFORMATION</h2>
    <p>We process your data for the following specific purposes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Identity Verification:</strong> Using biometrics to prevent unauthorised access to church funds and administrative tools.</li>
        <li><strong>Church Administration:</strong> maintaining accurate membership rolls and district records.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. BIOMETRIC DATA PROCESSING POLICY</h2>
    <p>In strict compliance with POPIA regarding Special Personal Information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Consent:</strong> Biometric data is only processed with explicit consent obtained during the setup of Overseer or Committee profiles.</li>
        <li><strong>Purpose Limitation:</strong> Biometric data is used <em>solely</em> for authentication and security. It is never sold, shared for marketing, or used for surveillance.</li>
        <li><strong>Retention:</strong> Biometric templates are deleted immediately upon the revocation of your Overseer or Committee status.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. SHARING OF INFORMATION</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>With Service Providers:</strong> Trusted third parties who assist us in operating the app (e.g., cloud hosting, payment processors), subject to confidentiality agreements.</li>
        <li><strong>With Educational Institutions:</strong> When you use TACTSO to apply for university, your data is shared with the specific institution you selected.</li>
        <li><strong>With Legal Authorities:</strong> If required by law, court order, or to protect the rights and safety of TACT and its members.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. DATA SECURITY</h2>
    <p>We implement technical and organisational measures to secure your personal information, including encryption of data in transit and at rest, strict access controls, and regular security audits. However, no internet transmission is completely secure, and you use the Platform at your own risk.</p>

        <li><strong>Objection:</strong> Object to the processing of your personal information on reasonable grounds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>8. RETENTION OF DATA</h2>
    <p>We retain your personal information only for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purposes for which it was collected, or as required by law (e.g., tax laws require retaining financial records for 5 years).</p>
